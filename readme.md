# Flocking Simulation
"In 1986 I made a computer model of coordinated animal motion such as bird 
flocks and fish schools. It was based on three dimensional computational 
geometry of the sort normally used in computer animation or computer aided 
design. I called the generic simulated flocking creatures boids. The basic 
flocking model consists of three simple steering behaviors which describe 
how an individual boid maneuvers based on the positions and velocities its 
nearby flockmates"... (https://red3d.com/cwr/boids/)
